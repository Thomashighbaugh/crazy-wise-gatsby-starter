THIS STYLE SHEET WAS SCAFFOLDED BY A SCRIPT I WROTE THEN MODIFIED, SOME AUTO-GENERATED FILES REMAIN BLANK FOR NOW

this file calls all the SCSS

Order:     vendors(external libraries rolled in) > base (normalize scss to standardize rendering) > helpers (variables, other SCSS specific features)
Matters:   > components (individual objects) > pages (each site page) > layout (a wrapper everythhing is pulled through)

This file is called and thus all is evenly applied in the layout, which everything else requires to add in metadata and <head> attributes
