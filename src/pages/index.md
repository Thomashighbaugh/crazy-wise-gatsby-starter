    This is just dummy text: I don't like or use Lorem Ipsum,
description: >-
  I am fully capable 
  of blabbering endlessly via typed text, or spoken words really, so using 
  dummy text seems like it betrays a serious lack of creativity.
  In the 1400s, when the early printing press was made, the copysetting part
  of printing books required pulling out and placing back in some really awful
  metal blocks, so maybe in that case I understand Lorem Ipsum (which is where
  it comes from)

        This site is another excellent example of the pain in my a@@ that web development
        seems endlessly to be. I had to fight with Node.js versions, because it has a 
        terribly crappy system of dealing with updates and NPM/Yarn make it even worse.

        I have selected, though may change, a very minimalistic theme for the time being.
        While minimalism is in, I think it looks God awful personally. I prefer dark 
        themes personally, but due to accessibility concerns, don't use them in school submissions

        While I will later compose this as HTML, I am just looking to fill some space so the 
        things we still need to do are: a) I need to reorganize the template directory garbage, 
        b) we need to fill these pages with text and better graphics, c) we need to configure the 
        cms (content management system) d) add another page, e) comment at the head of each file about 
        what it is and what it does f) comment functional portions of code

        All of the images on this page are random images from a 
        folder on my SD card I use for backup. Some are 60s scifi magazine
        covers, others are wallpapers (or the basis for them)
  heading: What we offer

    Very soon, I will have the real text up for this particular portion of 
    the site, but for now pardon my dust.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
