Some Lists in Markdown

- GTK themes
- Icon themes
- Fonts (with certain specific exceptions)
- Wallpapers (except the default if its specific and different from the OS default)
- .emacs.d (Emacs configuration directory with all its add-ons installed within)
- GIMP/Inkscape directory (with all the plugins, textures, etc)

You are also wise to avoid including the following as they don't seem to work or reveal personal information (luckily not earned in blood)

- Gnome settings
- firefox user profiles
- passwd files
- files containing one's logins in general
- visudo files
- crypto currency wallet ids
