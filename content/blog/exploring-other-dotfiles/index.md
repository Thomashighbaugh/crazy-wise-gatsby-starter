## Post 4

Markdown is essentially an HTML prototyping format, like Pug. All of these, as well as HTML itself,
are just a form of document creating. If you think of HTML as just MSWord, only insted of menus you
use tags, then its easier to deal with mentally.

Markdown also accepts some (most) HTML tags, just not usually much formatting as that is provided here by the SCSS and
Gatsby.
