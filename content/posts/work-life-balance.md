Balancing the overwhelming demands of both school and work is no easy feat. Unfortunately it’sa task that many students
that attend community college must face. Although it can be challenging these tips are sure to help you gain balance in
your life.

## Good Time Management

In order to create balance in your personal and professional life you must know that time is precious, but before you
decide how much time you devote to what tasks you must first know yourself. If you know that you work more efficiently
in the morning grind out what must be done then or vice versa. If you know that you are too tired after work to complete
even the smallest assignments, be sure to reserve time before your shift to get your work done. Sometimes sacrifices
must be made, whether that be staying up later than normal or studying throughout the weekend. The next tip goes hand

Organization is key to staying sane as a student. Planners are crucial for prioritizing what must get done throughout
the week. Many of them include an hourly breakdown of the day, which can help greatly with time management. It’s so
easy to miss due dates once we get caught up in daily life, but writing everything out on a calendar is sure to keep
you prepared. Also, be sure to organize when it comes to your assignments and study materials as well. Instead of
tossing papers and supplies in your bag once class ends, have a designated folder, notebook, or binder for each course.

## Communicating Your Needs

It may be intimidating to speak to your boss, but if they know that you’re also a student they will most likely
understand and make accommodations. It helps to inform them ahead of time of high stress times in the semester such
as midterms, so they know that you will be taking time off work. If for some reason you find yourself in a situation
where work is over demanding you may need to consider other employment options or working part-time. Everything is
easier when you have a support system around you. Making friends in each of your classes can help you stay on top
of things. From study groups to having someone reach out to in case you miss a lecture,communicate with those around
you while making sure not to lean on anyone excessively.
